He said I'll be back to you soon. Thanks like you're being so helpful but he just did not even get back to me and tell me what was happening and then he called me back to the store and they had.No idea how to help, maybe help me.So is there anyway you can report what he did? Because it was really bad and we had no dinner. We had toast for dinner. OK, I'll just take note of that. OK, and I'll, I'll check my.'cause he said to me I'll be back with you and then come back and he got it.

But like yes, ma'am. Oh, if you want mom I can, uh, put you to my supervisor and you cannot tell about this, OK?No, maybe that's OK. Don't worry, as long as the guy get like just maybe he gets told not to do that because that he shouldn't have done that. The store couldn't help me, they didn't know what I was talking about.
